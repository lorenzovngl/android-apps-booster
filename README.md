# ðŸš€ Android Apps Booster

This is a repository that aims to help new open source Android apps to emerge.

In my experience, it is very difficult to promote your project if you don't have a good following on social networks. Google Play Store and GitHub have trending pages, but, obviously, these pages contains only apps with thousands of downloads. The only way to discover new projects is to look at [recently updated repositories in Android topic on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/android?o=desc&s=updated).

With Android Apps Booster, I would like to help small apps get users and get better known, because I think it's bad that great projects got stuck because they struggle to get visibility.

The reference metric is the number of downloads. The apps are grouped in sections (<100 downloads, 101-500 downloads, 501-1.000 downloads, etc..) and apps belonging to the same section are sorted alphabetically, so the less downloaded ones get more visibility.

The requirements are:

- The app is open source.
- The app is downloadable from Play Store or as a release from its GitHub repository. This is necessary to obtain the number of downloads.
- The app received its last commit no more than a year ago.

If your app meets the requirements and you would like it to appear in this list, please open a [pull request](https://github.com/lorenzovngl/android-apps-booster/pulls) and report it.
